# gta-radio

This is a basic serveless audio player that acts like a radio, it changes the Audio tag src depending which div you click, and adds a random time to the selected file.

[FIXED] - Problems with async/await | promises;

[FIXED] - Problems attribute src returning undefined;

[FIXED] - Problems with mobile visuals;

Turns out the problem was right in my face the whole time, the ID returned when a click happens was returning undefined, even after using the using promises to get the audio source.

It supports all kind of mobiles, still working on bigger screens, but you should be fine.
